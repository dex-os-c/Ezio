"""
extractor/relationship_extract.py — LLM-assisted *typed* relationship extraction.

This is a distinct pass from entity extraction.  Entity extraction answers
"what things are on this page"; this pass answers the different question
"how are those already-identified things related".  It reuses the page content
already read for entity extraction (no new scraping/chunking pipeline) plus the
list of entities already found on that page, and asks the LLM which specific,
typed relationship (if any) connects each pair.

Design constraints (see the task spec and CHANGELOG STIX saga):

* **Bounded vocabulary.**  The LLM may only emit one of a small, fixed set of
  relationship types (`_LLM_REL_VOCAB`).  Anything it cannot map cleanly is
  dropped — the pair then simply keeps its plain co-occurrence edge, which is
  generated independently by the graph builder.  We never invent new types.
* **Claim-specific confidence.**  Each returned relationship carries its own
  confidence for *that claim*, separate from the confidence of the two
  entities it connects.  A low-confidence relationship between two
  high-confidence entities stays low-confidence.
* **Additive, never replacing.**  This pass only ever *adds* typed edges where
  there is genuine evidence.  Co-occurrence edges are untouched.
* **Bounded cost.**  One LLM call per page, over a leading content window, and
  never more than `max_rel_pages` pages per investigation (mirrors the
  entity-extraction `MAX_LLM_PAGES_PER_INV` cap).  This is the specific guard
  against the historical near-cartesian relationship explosion.
