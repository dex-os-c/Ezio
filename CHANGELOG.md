# Changelog

All notable changes to Ezio are documented here.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-08-04

- Enforce owner-only permissions on the project `.env` in both CLI configure
  and setup flows, using the same protection path as `~/.ezio/config.json`.
- Add a one-time legacy-data backfill for typed relationship page provenance
  and persisted community partitions.
- Re-verify typed-relationship yield on five fresh real investigations and
  record the measured baseline in the release audit.

## [1.9.4] - 2026-07-27

- Version bump.

## [1.9.3] - 2026-07-24

- STIX malware exports classify ransomware groups as `ransomware` and use
  available malware metadata/family-name signals for additional STIX malware
  types; unknown families retain the valid generic type rather than receiving
  a speculative label.
- Deterministic embedding fallback selection and its operator notice now occur
  before the small-investigation page-selection shortcut, so missing torch is
  visible on the first applicable run.
- Modernized stale test fixtures for canonical values and calibrated
  confidence output, and made null `DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT` lookups safe.
- Cross-process optional-configuration warning suppression is explicitly
  **won't-fix**: the existing process-scoped guard is sufficient for the
  operator warning, while a persistent marker would add filesystem state,
  expiry/race handling, and cleanup complexity for a minor UX issue.

## [1.9.2] - 2026-07-24

- Preserve typed graph relationships in MISP object references and map
  organization targets to STIX `targets` relationships.
- Prevent export output collisions, document the optional vector dependency,
  surface deterministic embedding fallback use, and warn once for dropped or
  legacy configuration keys.
- Warning deduplication remains process-scoped: separate CLI invocations are
  separate processes, so repeating a warning across invocations is expected
  and does not justify persistent state for this minor UX case.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-07-23

- Defer CLI/runtime configuration until after environment injection.
- Preserve configured LLM credentials through all CLI model construction paths.
- Surface graph-build row and edge metrics in the live CLI display.
- Correct rejected-query exit codes and relationship counts in summaries.
- Restore once-per-process optional-configuration warning behavior.
- Keep LockBit/LockBit4 observations distinct unless evidence supports a
  conservative relationship, avoiding unsafe automatic entity merges.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-07-23

### Changed
- Entity identity is now derived through a single shared module,
  `extractor/identity.py` (`entity_graph_id` / `entity_canonical_id` /
  `entity_display_id`). The graph builder (`_make_node_id`), the STIX / MISP /
  Sigma / IOC-package exporters, and the entity API were migrated off their own
  independent identity logic onto it, so a graph node key and an exporter's
  lookup key can no longer silently diverge (the recurring STIX threat-actor
  "silently dropped relationships" bug class). `NormalizedEntity.canonical_value`
  now returns the genuine canonical form instead of the raw value.

### Fixed
- Confidence now follows one monotonic, max-based rule across extraction,
  corroboration boosts, database upserts, and consumers; relationship type
  definitions are sourced from `graph/model.py`; and `merge_with_db` now
  records the page host in `corroborating_sources` for every persisted entity.
  This resolves the three-times-carried corroboration bug from 1.6.4, 1.7.0,
  and 1.7.1.

- Consolidated confidence consistency and edge-type vocabulary across
  extraction, persistence, graph construction, and exports; fixed
  `corroborating_sources`, closing a three-cycle-old known issue.
- Completed the seven-phase identity-drift remediation through the canonical
  identity module and migrated graph, STIX, MISP, IOC package, Snort, YARA,
  CLI browser, `show`, and investigation consumers.
- Improved CLI honesty with 500-character query validation, live graph-build
  progress, explicit zero-relationship distinctions, visible degraded
  community-detection states, expanded completion metrics, and per-source
  outcome tables.
- Verified mixed-case and EIP-55 identity behavior with repo-wide sweeps.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-07-23

- Preserve `page_id` in the CLI's lightweight `pages_scraped` manifest so
  typed relationship provenance resolves to the source page.
- Add prompt-level and post-LLM endpoint-type compatibility validation for
  typed relationships; structurally invalid pairs are excluded.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-07-22
### Fixed
- `--no-tor` now generates **zero** Tor traffic for the entire run. Previously the flag only skipped the primary Tor search branch; the Torch/Haystack onion search engines still ran and fed real `.onion` result URLs into the scrape list, which were then routed back through Tor. The onion search engines are now skipped when `--no-tor` is set, and any `.onion` link from any source is stripped before the scraper sees it — so no outbound connection to the Tor SOCKS proxy is ever attempted and no onion-sourced pages appear in the output.
- Typed relationship extraction now works against the real LLM adapter. The call built a silent client with `llm.bind(callbacks=[])`, which LangChain forwarded to `agenerate_prompt` as a keyword while `ainvoke` also passed `callbacks` explicitly, raising `got multiple values for keyword argument 'callbacks'` on every page and silently degrading to zero typed relationships. It now uses `with_config({"callbacks": []})` (matching the entity-extraction path), and a failed relationship LLM call logs a visible warning distinct from a call that genuinely found no relationship.
- Step-cost metrics (`investigation_step_metrics`) are no longer written all-zero from the CLI. The CLI created the metrics collector but never started/finished steps or recorded scraping, so `duration_ms`, `llm_calls`, and the page-fetch counters stayed zero even though work was happening (and `record_llm_call` only credits an *active* step). The CLI pipeline is now instrumented per step like the API path, so durations, per-step LLM-call counts, and page-fetch counters reflect real values.
- Empty, whitespace-only, and trivially short (< 3 character) investigation queries are now rejected up front with a clear message, before any network activity — instead of silently proceeding to produce a full, confident-looking report from generic noise.
- Non-actionable IP addresses are now filtered alongside the existing RFC 5737 documentation ranges: `0.0.0.0`, the broadcast address, and well-known public DNS resolvers (`8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`, `1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1`, Quad9, OpenDNS, Level3). They no longer appear in the persisted entity store or the exported `ip_addresses.txt`, so a user importing that file into a blocklist can't accidentally block a legitimate resolver or a null route.
- ransomlook.io and ransomware.live group matching is now token-based. The old logic required the entire query string to appear literally in a tracked group name, so realistic analyst queries like `"LockBit ransomware leak site"` matched nothing even though `lockbit3` exists. Generic words are stripped and the meaningful token(s) are matched against group names (`lockbit` → `lockbit`, `lockbit2`, `lockbit3`); a genuine no-match still reports `ok_0_results` honestly.

### Changed
- The typed-relationship vocabulary term `USED` was renamed to **`USES`** for a consistent, externally-visible name across the LLM prompt/parser, the internal storage type (`RelationshipType`/`EDGE_TYPES`), the API response, and the STIX export mapping (`USES` → STIX `uses`).
- Version bumped to 1.8.1 (`pyproject.toml`, `ezio_cli.__version__`, IOC package `PACKAGE_VERSION`).

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-22
### Added
- Five new free (key-optional) intelligence sources, each reporting honestly into `sources_used`:
  - **XposedOrNot** (`sources/breach_lookup.py`) — email breach-exposure lookup, complements HIBP with a different corpus; free tier includes stealer-log exposure.
  - **LeakCheck** public tier (`sources/breach_lookup.py`) — breach-source corroboration; an email surfacing in both XposedOrNot and LeakCheck is tagged `breach_corroborated`.
  - **Hudson Rock Cavalier** (`sources/infostealer.py`) — infostealer intelligence (30M+ malware-infected machines) queried by email AND domain; one of the few sources giving domain-level infostealer exposure.
  - **NVD 2.0** (`sources/nvd.py`) — full CVE metadata (CVSS, CWE, description, dates) for any extracted CVE, complementing CISA KEV's actively-exploited subset. Optional `NVD_API_KEY` raises the rate limit.
  - **ransomlook.io** (`sources/enrichment.py`) — second ransomware-group tracker that cross-validates ransomware.live; shared leak-site `.onion` seeds are URL-normalised to dedup across the two trackers.
- First pytest test suite (`tests/`), covering the parsers for the five new sources with mocked HTTP (`aioresponses`).

### Fixed
- Phase-A threat-intel enrichment now preserves the results of sources that finished before the deadline instead of discarding the entire batch when the 59s/55s cap is hit (`_gather_with_partial_results`).
- CLI `investigate` reputation steps (domain/hash/email) no longer clobber the threaded `extraction_results` list into a `(results, stats)` tuple, which had silently starved subsequent steps and actor-profile aggregation of entities.
- Typed relationship edges. A distinct LLM relationship-extraction pass (`extractor/relationship_extract.py`) runs after entity extraction and asks, for the entities already found on a page, which specific typed relationship (if any) connects them — `USED`, `DROPS`, `CONTROLS`, `TARGETS`, `EXPLOITS`, `COMMUNICATES_WITH`. Each relationship carries its own claim confidence, separate from the confidence of the two entities it connects. The vocabulary is bounded: anything the LLM cannot map cleanly is dropped and the pair keeps its plain co-occurrence edge.
- The pass is additive — co-occurrence edge generation is unchanged; typed edges sit alongside it. Bounded by `MAX_REL_PAGES_PER_INV` (default 10; one LLM call per selected page) so it can never scale unbounded with page count, mirroring the existing `MAX_LLM_PAGES_PER_INV` entity-extraction cap. Disable with `ENABLE_RELATIONSHIP_EXTRACTION=false`.

### Fixed
- STIX export keyed its entity→object map only by raw entity value, so graph edges whose node id is disambiguated (e.g. `THREAT_ACTOR_HANDLE` as `handle@forum`) were silently dropped from the bundle. The map now also registers the graph node id, so relationships with a threat-actor endpoint — including the new typed relationships — survive into the bundle.

### Changed
- STIX `Relationship` SROs now carry the edge's confidence (STIX 2.1 `confidence`, 0–100), and the new typed edge types map to documented STIX relationship types (`uses`, `drops`, `targets`, `exploits`, `communicates-with`); `CONTROLS` has no standard STIX verb and degrades to `related-to`. `CO_INVESTIGATION` now has an explicit mapping instead of relying on the default.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-07-08
### Fixed
- STIX relationship generation now avoids near-quadratic same-page edge explosions by emitting bounded semantic co-occurrence edges instead of every pair on a page.
- Persistent relationship loading now skips malformed non-UUID endpoints before graph hydration, preventing UUID coercion crashes during STIX export.
- THREAT_ACTOR_HANDLE and ORGANIZATION_NAME NER noise from repeated audits is filtered before persistence, including the confirmed generic security/programming vocabulary false positives.
- MISP, Sigma, API, and shared DB query paths now use explicit SQLAlchemy select constructs instead of passing subquery objects into `.in_()`.
- Optional configuration warnings are summarized once per process instead of printing a repeated warning wall.
- Refined query persistence now strips labelled/chatty LLM responses down to the actual short search query.

### Changed
- Tor result-count variance was reassessed as environmental network/search-engine flakiness for this pass; no code change was made for that item.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-07-07
### Fixed
- STIX export was silently producing an empty 82-byte bundle (regression from 1.6.3's working fix); now produces real bundles with entities and relationships
- Entity extraction quality had regressed on queries containing CVE/financial terms, returning only organization-name noise; CVE extraction now works correctly
- Confidence scores were clustered at 1-2 discrete values across an entire investigation; now show genuine multi-value spread reflecting source quality, extraction method, and corroboration
- Source-quality scoring (previously claimed but not actually implemented) is now genuinely present on extracted entities and contributes to confidence
- Fixed a CLI readback bug where entities were successfully extracted and persisted but the final displayed/exported count could read as zero, because the query only checked direct investigation_id matches and ignored entities linked via InvestigationEntityLink
- Fixed duplicate canonical entities appearing in results when the same entity existed in both the direct-match and linked-match branches of the entity query; results are now deduped after the union, not before

### Known Issues
- corroborating_sources field still not populated (carried over from 1.6.4, tracked separately)

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-07
### Fixed
- --version now works as a top-level flag
- config.json now written with 0600 permissions
- Entities from Tor/.onion pages now persist to the entity store
- RFC 5737/2606 placeholder IPs/domains/emails filtered or flagged instead of treated as high-confidence threat intel
- Source-quality scoring added for low-trust sources (GitHub README docs)
- Stale OPENROUTER_API_KEY warning fixed
- Stuck 'running' investigation rows now cleaned up
- DATE entity extraction capped
- IOC package email export no longer drops emails
- STIX export SQLAlchemy warning fixed
- Non-interactive `ezio configure` input now detected and handled

### Changed
- sentence-transformers, torch, transformers, telethon, playwright moved to optional extras (`ezio[nlp]`, `[telegram]`, `[js]`, `[all]`)
- Added EZIO_NO_BANNER for session-level banner suppression

### Known Issues
- corroborating_sources not populated for any entity (tracked for next release)
- LLM may under-tag malware names present in summary but not in structured extraction

## [1.6.4] - 2026-07-07
### Fixed
- STIX relationship export now declares and installs its graph dependency, and export commands visibly warn when relationships cannot be built.
- Added missing third-party dependency declarations for imported libraries across the codebase.
- Entity store `corroborating_sources` field is silently null for all entities because `merge_with_db` in `extractor/normalizer.py` never calls `update_entity_source_count` after the initial upsert. Every entity — from tor_search, RSS, GitHub, or enrichment — has `source_count=1` and `corroborating_sources=null` instead of the source name (e.g. `["tor_search"]`). Fix requires calling `update_entity_source_count` in `merge_with_db` after each upsert, passing the page's source label derived from the page URL. Tracked as a separate fix cycle — do not treat as a footnote.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-07-07
### Fixed
- LLM entity extraction no longer streams raw JSON fragments to stdout during investigations with LLM enabled.
- STIX export no longer writes an empty bundle silently when `stix2` is missing; `stix2` is now a declared dependency and the export produces a real bundle.
- `click` is now a declared dependency, so the first-run spaCy model download triggered by `ezio configure` no longer fails silently and leave NER disabled.
- `use_proxies` and `use_proxy` config flags have been renamed to `rest_api_transport_enabled` and `residential_proxy_enabled`, with automatic migration for existing config files and a fix for BOM-prefixed JSON loading.

### Known Issues
- (Resolved in v1.6.4) Entity extraction and persistence from Tor/.onion pages is now confirmed working end-to-end.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-07-03
### Added
- Clarified the final release state after the residential proxy fallback QA pass and the `--use-scraping-api` transport reintroduction.
- Confirmed the six live-verified safety guarantees from the verification arc, including silent fallback behavior when proxy credentials are invalid.

### Fixed
- Residential proxy credential handling and release metadata alignment.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-02
### Added
- Optional clearnet ScrapingAnt integration for paste sites and RSS feeds.
- Three independent ScrapingAnt products are now documented and supported separately: Web Scraping API, Residential Proxy transport, and Datacenter Proxy transport.
- Web Scraping API transport uses `EZIO_USE_PROXIES=true` and `SCRAPINGANT_API_KEY`.
- Residential Proxy transport uses `EZIO_USE_PROXY=true` with `SCRAPINGANT_PROXY_USERNAME` and `SCRAPINGANT_PROXY_PASSWORD`.
- Datacenter Proxy transport is configured with `SCRAPINGANT_PROXY_TYPE=datacenter` and the same proxy credentials, but live verification is still open.
- The transport selection model is mutually exclusive per request; if both transports are enabled, the proxy transport wins for that request and the chokepoint logs the choice once.
- Tor, `.onion`, GitHub, and GitLab traffic remain unaffected by the integration.

### Fixed
- Corrected earlier documentation and configuration drift that conflated the Web Scraping API credential with the proxy credentials and described the wrong host model.
- Clarified that there is no chained transport mode.
