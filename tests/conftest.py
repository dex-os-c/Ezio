"""
tests/conftest.py — shared fixtures for the Ezio test suite.

The enrichment-source modules use two kinds of module-level singletons that are
sensitive to the event loop / process state:

  1. An enrichment-cache singleton (``_enrichment_cache_singleton``). Left alone
     it defaults to the SQLite backend at ``~/.ezio/cache.db``, which would
     persist between test runs and turn mocked HTTP responses into stale cache
     hits. We force a fresh in-memory cache per test.
  2. Lazy ``asyncio.Semaphore`` singletons bound to the loop they were created
     on. pytest-asyncio uses a fresh loop per test, so a semaphore created in a
     previous test would raise "bound to a different event loop". We reset them.

The ``reset_source_state`` fixture is autouse so every test starts clean.
