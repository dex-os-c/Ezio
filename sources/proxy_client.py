sources/proxy_client.py — Clearnet HTTP chokepoint with single-transport selection.

Phase 1.6 (corrected per architect review against the official docs) —
single-axis dispatch on clearnet HTTP fetches:

    Transport:  How requests reach ScrapingAnt's backend
    ---------   --------------------------------------------------------
    direct      Local aiohttp.ClientSession, no proxy (pre-1.6.2 behavior)
    api         POST to https://api.scrapingant.com/v2/general (REST)
    proxy       HTTP CONNECT through the configured ScrapingAnt proxy endpoint (proxy transport)

    Exactly ONE transport is selected per request. The proxy and api
    transports are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE alternates — never chained.

Architectural grounding (verified against ScrapingAnt docs):

    1. Proxy transport uses the dashboard-issued
       SCRAPINGANT_PROXY_USERNAME + SCRAPINGANT_PROXY_PASSWORD credential
       pair, separate from SCRAPINGANT_API_KEY. Optional API parameters
       (browser=false, proxy_type=residential|datacenter,
       forward_headers=true, ...) are appended to the proxy username.

       Source: https://docs.scrapingant.com/proxy-mode, §Integration details
       Quote: "Username: scrapingant + API parameters separated by &
       delimiter. Password: YOUR-API-KEY."

    2. There is ONE documented proxy hostname: the configured ScrapingAnt proxy endpoint
       (HTTP on port 8080, HTTPS on port 443). Pool type (residential
       vs datacenter) is passed as `proxy_type=` in the username string,
       NOT as a different hostname.

       Source: https://docs.scrapingant.com/proxy-mode, §Integration details
       Quote: "HTTP address: the configured ScrapingAnt proxy endpoint"
       Quote: "For example, to disable browser rendering and use
       residential proxies, you can use the following username:
       the ScrapingAnt proxy username string"

    3. the proxy transport is "a light front-end for the scraping API" with
       "all the same functionality and performance" and the same
       billing — it is an ALTERNATE TRANSPORT to the identical
       backend service, not a stackable layer in front of the REST API.

       Source: https://docs.scrapingant.com/proxy-mode, §Introduction
       Quote: "The proxy transport is a light front-end for the scraping
       API and has all the same functionality and performance as
       sending requests to the API endpoint."

Scope (locked, do not revisit):
    Called only from sources/paste_scraper.py and sources/rss_scraper.py.
    github_scraper.py and gitlab_scraper.py are PERMANENTLY excluded —
    they carry auth tokens that must never transit any third-party
    proxy, including ScrapingAnt's.

Design:
    - Single chokepoint: ``clearnet_fetch(...)``.
    - Hard, unconditional .onion guard FIRST (before any network call,
      before any transport selection) — fires regardless of which
      transport is selected, even when direct (none) is selected.
      This is a routing invariant, not a proxy concern.
    - Single transport per request, picked by config:
        - If EZIO_USE_PROXY=true (and the proxy username/password pair
          is set) → proxy
        - Else if EZIO_USE_PROXIES=true (legacy pre-1.6.2,
          and SCRAPINGANT_API_KEY set) → api
        - Else → direct
      If BOTH EZIO_USE_PROXY and EZIO_USE_PROXIES are set,
      proxy wins (with a one-shot info log); there is no chained mode.
    - Selected transport is tried first; on any failure (timeout, 5xx,
      auth error, malformed response) the chokepoint silently falls
      through to direct. No exception propagates to the scraper.
    - browser=false is hardcoded on the api transport; the proxy
      transport includes browser=false in the username string per docs
      ("As browser rendering is enabled by default, we recommend to
      disable it while using ScrapingAnt proxy transport"). The two paths
      preserve raw text/XML bytes identically.
    - SCRAPINGANT_API_KEY is exclusively the REST Web Scraping API
      credential. Proxy transport uses the separate dashboard-issued
      SCRAPINGANT_PROXY_USERNAME + SCRAPINGANT_PROXY_PASSWORD pair.
    - No import from scraper/ — sources/scraper firewall preserved.

The cap constant ``MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`` mirrors scraper/scrape.py's
MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES (1_000_000) — do not import from scraper/ (firewall).
