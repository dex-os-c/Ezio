    Why this path is different from every other Tor fetcher in the codebase:
    Playwright's driver rejects SOCKS5 credentials for any `socks5://` proxy URL,
    at launch and at context creation alike, so the credential-per-hostname
    mechanism in `scraper/tor_pool.py` is unreachable from Chromium.  Isolation
    has to come from Tor's own `IsolateDestAddr` on a dedicated SocksPort
    instead (docker/Dockerfile.tor opens 9250).

    If that port is not listening we return the ordinary port and log a single
    warning.  Degrading loudly is the point: a silent fallback would leave the
    JS-render path sharing one circuit across every onion host while the rest of
    the system looks isolated.
